# Athena
The only Informal Secure P2P Credit Service to ever exist.

# Problem Statement & Proposed Solution:
In the Indian Market, people love negotiating, so why not let the people negotiate while acquiring informal credit? These P2P Informal Lending Transactions carry a huge risk, we plan to curb this problem by providing a platform that ensures the same level of security as formal credit but with P2P lending. We have adopted the concept of Credit Score and applied it to the Web3 ecosystem by providing a very complicated and thorough financial check of both the lender and the borrower so that we can give both parties peace of mind that their coins are safe. As the web3 revolution picks pace we plan on targeting the common users who need to be educated about the secure ecosystem of ether and how it can change their life for good.
We have multiple features to keep the users engaged with our platform:

1. Easy Onboarding Process:
    1. Two-Click Onboarding to enhance User Experience.
    2. Users can easily sign up with their username and password.
    3. Users can also sign up with their World ID for Sybil Resistance.

2. Lendors Verification:
    1. Users can verify their identity without uploading any Government ID and hence provide anonymity to our users.

3. Interest Negotiation:
    1. Borrowers and Lendors can negotiate the interest rates of the Credit Transaction.
    2. Provides more freedom of choice for both the parties

4. Debit Score Verification:
    1. We provide verfication for all of our users by using various formulations on the user's current as well as historical financial holdings.
    2. Users can verify their Debit Score by syncing their wallets.

# TL;DR:
We offer our Platform as a service (PaaS) for users to engage in a P2P Informal Credit Transaction with verified Lendor and Borrower accounts and give them back their right to negotiate.

# Challenges We Ran Into:
1. Since our backend team was focused on python we found integrating a lot of web3 SDKs and frameworks quite challenging.
2. Due to the lack of documentation of various APIs in Python, we had to spend quite a lot of time in trial and error to make things work and implement the modules in a proper manner.
3. The scale of our idea is too big and thus being able to complete such a passionate project with a genuine idea at its core within the given time limits was very challenging.
